This is a FontForge version of the script made by Pablo Impallari for Fontlab (see http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/spacing-macro).

Place spacing.py and default-spacing.txt in ~/.FontForge/python. 

Usage
------------------

Place a copy of default-spacing.txt in the same directory of the font you are working on. Rename it "spacing.txt", modify the numbers, run the the script (FontForge->Tools menu).
